## Staring stencils leak; erosion leaves most of the skeleton unconstrained

**Status:** confirmed — all 560 labelled challenge scans (358 patients: train,
val, test and single-session), ground-truth CT labels. Identical across splits.

- The Staring rigidity terms read the 18 neighbours within one voxel (6 face
  neighbours for det(J) / orthonormality, plus 12 edge neighbours for the mixed
  second derivatives of the affine term).
- On the full bone mask, **21.2% ± 1.2%** of these stencil reads fall outside
  the centre voxel's own bone (soft tissue or a neighbouring bone), so the term
  also constrains surrounding tissue (per scan, range 16–24%).
- Eroding each bone by exactly this footprint removes the leakage (0% on every
  scan), but keeps only **35.5% ± 2.2%** of bone voxels, and **23%** of bones
  lose their interior entirely.
- By bone group (voxels kept / bones that vanish):
  - ribs: **2.4%** / **58%**
  - vertebrae: 22% / 0.7%
  - other bones: 39% / 0%
- Implication: Staring + erosion leaves most of the skeleton, and the rib cage
  almost entirely, unconstrained; Kabsch needs no erosion and has no stencil
  leakage by construction.
